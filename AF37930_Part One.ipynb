The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is\\nmoderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\\nventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular\\nwall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is\\nhyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an\\nincreased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right\\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The\\naortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is\\nsevere aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic\\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\\nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe\\nmitral annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral\\nregurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity\\nof mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]\\nThere is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is\\nno pericardial effusion.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with\\nhyperdynamic systolic function. Severe aortic stenosis. Mild to\\nmoderate mitral regurgitation.\\n--CT chest:Small bilateral pleural effusion. Complete\\nobstruction of the left lower lobe\\nbronchus, could be due to foreign body, tumor or mucoid\\nimpaction with almost\\ncomplete collapse of the left lower lobe. Minimal septal\\nthickening and\\nmultifocal ground-glass opacity, could be due to mild\\ninterstitial edema.\\nMinimal emphysema. Scattered lymph nodes. Severe aortic valvular\\n\\ncalcification and mitral annulus calcification. Moderate\\ncoronary artery\\ncalcification.\\n\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\n# NSTEMI: Pt presented with CP to OSH which resolved with SL\\nNTG. Also had enzyme leak and ekg changes. She was continued ASA\\n325, Lipitor 80, BB and heparin drip. She underwent cardiac cath\\nwhich showed three vessel coronary artery disease.  As she was\\nfound to have severe AS, and would require AVR in the future,\\nthe plan was to perform CABG at that time.  The patient wanted\\nto be dishcarged prior to surgery, thus scheduled to follow up\\nwith Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient this week.  She was discharged\\non high dose aspirin and statin as well as a beta blocker.  An\\nACE-I was not started given the patient's severe aortic\\nstenosis.\\n\\n# Severe Aortic Stenosis:   Previously the patient's documented\\nvalve area was 1 cm2, however on TTE here showed worsening AS\\nwith a valve area of 0.8cm2.  She was managed medically and will\\nhave AVr in the next few weeks.\\n\\n# Resp failure: Likely from pulmonary edema. She was diuresed\\ncarefull given AS and preload dependence. She was continued on\\npressure support while awaiting cath. After cath she was\\nextubated without difficulty. She remained without an o2\\nrequirement prior to discharge.\\n\\n# PNA: CXR showed possibility of post-obstructive PNA. She\\nunderwent chest CT which showed similar findings. A bronchoscopy\\nwas done which showed no mass. BAL washings were pending at time\\nof discharge and will be followed up by her pcp.\\n\\n# Fever: fever to 100.4. UA was positive and patient was started\\non Cipro and then switched to zosyn when Ct was read as positive\\nfor PNA. She was discharged on augmentin.\\n\\n# UTI: Patient was initially treated with Cipro however switched\\nto Zosyn for PNA coverage as above. Augmentin was continued on\\ndischarge.\\n\\n# HTN: continued metoprolol and amlodipine as patient had\\ntolerated them at home.\\n\\n# Depression: celexa\\n\\n# CODE: full.

Compared to the previous tracing of\\n[**2185-2-15**] the rate has slowed.

The estimated\\nright atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall\\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top\\nnormal/borderline dilated. There is moderate to severe regional\\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction with an apical left\\nventricular aneurysm and an inferobasal left ventricular\\naneurysm. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion\\nare normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.\\nThere is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic\\nregurgitation is seen.

Selective coronary angiography of\\nthis right dominant system revealed three vessel disease. The\\nLMCA had mild disease.  The LAD was diffusely diseased with 99%\\nstenosis at the mid segment.  The LCX was diffusely diseased\\nwith 50% stenosis at the proximal segment, 90% stenosis at the\\nmid segment after the first OM, and there was 70% stenosis\\nwithin the first OM.\\n2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided\\nfilling\\npressures consistent with diastolic dysfunction, with LVEDP 40\\nmm Hg. The systemic arterial pressure was elevated with central\\naortic pressure 184/79 mm Hg.  Careful pullback across the\\naortic valve did not reveal a significant gradient.\\n3. Patient was symptom free, and ECG done during catheterization\\nshowed resolution of ST segment changes.  Conservative\\nmanagement with blood pressure control and diuresis was elected\\nwith plan for CT surgery consult.\\n.\\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\\n1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.\\n2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.\\n\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\n81 yo female with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, apical\\naneurysm, CVA, CHF, presents with chest pain in setting of\\nuncontrolled hypertension now s/p cardiac catherization. As\\npatient was pain free with resolution of ST changes elected to\\npursue conservative management with BP control and diuresis and\\nwould consider PCI if recurrent symptoms.\\n.\\n# Chest pain: ST-elevations may have been secondary to\\naneurysmal changes noted on [**Hospital3 4107**] echocardiogram and\\nconfirmed on echocardiography today at [**Hospital1 18**]. Lack of\\nsignificant biomarker elevation suggests against significant\\nischemic territorial STEMI, and angiography suggests chronic RCA\\ngiven collateralization. Patient may have had symptoms secondary\\nto uncontrolled hypertension.  Patient was continued on aspirin,\\nstatin. Patient was continued on atorvastatin, metoprolol,\\nenalapril.
